allowedOrigins.js
corsOptions.js

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The allowedOrigins module is required. It is assumed that the allowedOrigins module exports an array of allowed origin URLs.
The corsOptions object is defined, which will be used as the CORS configuration.
The origin function is specified as the origin option for CORS. This function is called with the request's origin and a callback function.
Inside the origin function, it checks if the request's origin is allowed by checking if it exists in the allowedOrigins array. If the origin is allowed or if the origin is not provided (e.g., for same-origin requests), the callback is called with null as the first argument to indicate that the request is allowed.
If the request's origin is not allowed, the callback is called with an Error object as the first argument to indicate that the request is not allowed by CORS.
The credentials option is set to true, which allows credentials to be included in CORS requests (e.g., cookies, authorization headers).
The optionsSuccessStatus option is set to 200, indicating that the preflight (OPTIONS) request will respond with a 200 status code if successful.
The corsOptions object is exported to be used by the server.
